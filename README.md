# abxidx

The goal of abxidx is to calculate an index for a given bacterial
community’s susceptibility to a given antibiotic.

## Installation

You can install the development version of abxidx with `devtools`:

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tuv292/abxidx")
```

## Calculating antibiotic index values

Here, we’ll load the `abxidx` package, demonstrate some basic tasks, and
give some pointers for its use. Although we could accomplish all our
tasks in base R, the `abxidx` package works very nicely with functions
from the tidyverse. We’ll import those functions now.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

Next, we’ll load the `abxidx` library.

``` r
library(abxidx)
```

This package comes with a built-in data set, `weiss2021_data`, from a
study of the gut microbiota in children with sepsis (PMID 33786436). The
children in this study were exposed to a range of antibiotics, and fecal
samples were collected across a series of time windows after diagnosis
(`study_window` A-E). Bacterial communities in the fecal samples were
profiled by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene, which serves as a fingerprint
to identify bacteria in each sample. The study included samples from a
set of healthy children in a similar age group for comparison. Here is a
summary of the number of samples in each time window:

``` r
weiss2021_data %>%
  distinct(sample_id, study_group, study_window) %>%
  count(study_group, study_window) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| study\_group | study\_window |   n |
|:-------------|:--------------|----:|
| Healthy      | NA            |  44 |
| Sepsis       | A             |  17 |
| Sepsis       | B             |   9 |
| Sepsis       | C             |   7 |
| Sepsis       | D             |   2 |
| Sepsis       | E             |   8 |

for each sample collected, the data frame contains the relative
abundance of all bacteria with a proportion of more than 0.001. Here is
one of the sepsis samples, from subject 19019 in time window A. In this
sample, the sequencing results indicated the following types of
bacteria:

``` r
weiss2021_data %>%
  filter(sample_id %in% "Sepsis.19019.A") %>%
  select(lineage, proportion) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| lineage                                                                                                                          | proportion |

For each type of bacteria, the taxonomic assignment includes all the
taxon names from the kingdom on down to the most specific taxon that
could be determined from the sequence, in most cases the genus.
Following the (NCBI taxonomy
browser)\[<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy>\], we call this result
the lineage.

Our goal will be to use the lineage information to predict which
bacteria in each sample would be susceptible or resistant to various
antibiotics. For a given antibiotic, we construct an
*antibiotic-specific index* by taking the log-ratio of the abundance for
resistant organisms over that of susceptible organisms.

If the bacterial community is dominated by susceptible organisms, the
index will be negative. Conversely, the index is positive if susceptible
organisms constitute a minority. If an antibiotic has the predicted
effect on a bacterial community, the index should increase after the
antibiotic is introduced.

Let’s compute the vancomycin index for each sample in the study.

``` r
weiss2021_vanc <- weiss2021_data %>%
  group_by(sample_id, study_group, study_window) %>%
  summarise(vanc = vancomycin_index(proportion, lineage), .groups = "drop")

weiss2021_vanc %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=study_window, y = vanc)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(~ study_group, scales = "free_x", space = "free_x") +
  labs(x = "Study window", y = "Vancomycin-specific index")
```

![](tools/readme/weiss_vancomycin_index-1.png)<!-- -->

For healthy children, the medain value of the index is about 0.2,
whereas it is roughly 0.85 across the samples from children with sepsis.
Let’s look further into how the index was calculated, and check out
which bacteria were labeled as susceptible or resistant to vancomycin.

## Susceptible and resistant bacteria

The `abxidx` library offers some lower-level functions that show more
details about how the index was calculated. For each antibiotic with an
index function, there is an accompanying function to determine the
susceptibility for each lineage. Let’s list out the susceptibility for
the lineages in the sample from subject 19019:

``` r
weiss2021_data %>%
  filter(sample_id %in% "Sepsis.19019.A") %>%
  mutate(susceptibility = vancomycin_susceptibility(lineage)) %>%
  select(lineage, susceptibility) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| lineage                                                                                                                          | susceptibility |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------|
| k\_\_Bacteria; p\_\_Firmicutes; c\_\_Bacilli; o\_\_Lactobacillales; f\_\_Enterococcaceae; g\_\_Enterococcus                      | susceptible    |
| k\_\_Bacteria; p\_\_Firmicutes; c\_\_Bacilli; o\_\_Lactobacillales; f\_\_Lactobacillaceae                                        | susceptible    |
| k\_\_Bacteria; p\_\_Proteobacteria; c\_\_Gammaproteobacteria; o\_\_Pseudomonadales; f\_\_Pseudomonadaceae; g\_\_Pseudomonas      | resistant      |
| k\_\_Bacteria; p\_\_Proteobacteria; c\_\_Gammaproteobacteria; o\_\_Enterobacteriales; f\_\_Enterobacteriaceae                    | resistant      |
| k\_\_Bacteria; p\_\_Proteobacteria; c\_\_Gammaproteobacteria; o\_\_Xanthomonadales; f\_\_Xanthomonadaceae; g\_\_Stenotrophomonas | resistant      |
| k\_\_Bacteria; p\_\_Firmicutes; c\_\_Bacilli; o\_\_Bacillales; f\_\_Staphylococcaceae; g\_\_Staphylococcus                       | susceptible    |
| k\_\_Bacteria; p\_\_Actinobacteria; c\_\_Actinobacteria; o\_\_Actinomycetales; f\_\_Propionibacteriaceae                         | susceptible    |

Looking down the list of taxa, we can see that three of the seven are
from the *Firmicutes* phylum, in which the organisms are generally
characterized by a Gram-positive cell wall structure. Vancomycin’s
mechanism of action is to disrupt construction of the cell wall in
Gram-positive organisms, so we would generally predict that organisms in
this phylum would be susceptible to the antibiotic. Likewise, the
*Actinobacteria* are Gram-positive, so the final lineage is predicted to
be susceptible. The three remaining lineages are Gram-negative organisms
from the *Proteobacteria*, and are predicted to be resistant.

Now, if you’ve read the Wikipedia article on vancomycin, you might know
that most species of *Lactobacillus* are naturally resistant to the
drug, although they are Gram-positive bacteria in the *Firmicutes*
phylum. Here, we don’t have an assignment to the *Lactobacillus* genus,
but instead to the *Lactobacillaceae* family, so the prediction stands
as susceptible.

## Databases for bacterial phenotypes and antibiotic susceptibility

The `abxidx` package comes with two built-in databases. The
`taxon_phenotypes` database contains information on Gram-stain and
aerobic status for over 900 bacterial taxa. The taxa were selected to
cover many taxa encountered in the human microbiom. It is here where we
note that the *Firmicutes* are generally Gram-positive.

``` r
taxon_phenotypes %>%
  filter(taxon %in% "Firmicutes")
#>        taxon   rank aerobic_status    gram_stain                     doi
#> 1 Firmicutes Phylum           <NA> Gram-positive 10.1099/00207713-28-1-1
```

The second database `taxon_susceptibility`, contains information about
bacterial susceptibility to specific antibiotics. It is here, for
example, where we note that *Lactobacillus* species are typically
resistant to vancomycin.

``` r
taxon_susceptibility %>%
  filter(taxon %in% "Lactobacillus")
#>           taxon  rank antibiotic     value                  doi
#> 1 Lactobacillus Genus vancomycin resistant 10.1128/AEM.01738-18
```

If you need to add or modify information in these databases, you can
copy the data frames to new variables, make the changes you’d like, and
pass the new databases directly to the `vancomycin_index` or
`vancomycin_susceptibility` functions.
